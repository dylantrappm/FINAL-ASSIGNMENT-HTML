        <p>Here is a collection of my favorite Web sites, organized by general catergories. Check them out and feel free to contact me with suggestions or problems. Here are the categories.</p>
    </header>
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#gold">Gold and Silver Bullion</a></li>
            <li><a href="#car">Car Parts</a></li>
            <li><a href="#animals">Pets and Fish</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="gold">Gold and Silver Bullion</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://www.jmbullion.com">JMBullion</a></dt>
            <dd>This is the website I bought my first silver coins from. It has many differet options and I like that there is free shipping on orders over $100. This website sells silver and gold coins, bars, and vintage currency. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.apmex.com">APMEX</a></dt>
            <dd>This is another website very similar to JMBullion. I usually use this website as well to compare pricing between the two to make sure I'm getting the most for my money. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://goldsilver.com/price-charts/">GoldSilver</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a website to check the "spot" price of gold and silver. The price of gold and silver changes daily so it is important to keep track of the prices. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="car">Car Parts</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://www.fcpeuro.com">FPC Euro</a></dt>
            <dd>This website offers lifetime guarantees on all car parts, period. I can buy brakes, use them for 3 years, and send them back and they will refund you. You can even send back your used oil!</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://performancebyie.com">Integrated Engineering</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a tuning company to retune the ECU (cars computer) in your car. They have retuned my ECU to make my car higher performance. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.rockauto.com">Rock Auto</a></dt>
            <dd>This is typically going to be the best prices for all things auto repair. It is hard to find any website that is cheaper but I do not use it very much just because they do not offer lifetime warranty like FPC Euro does. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="animals">Pets and Fish</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore">Petco</a></dt>
            <dd>Petco is a pet store that sells animals, and animal supplies. The reason I like Petco is because they are everywhere and it is really convienant when I need to buy my dog food or get supplies for my aquariums. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.aquariumcoop.com">Aquarium Co-op</a></dt>
            <dd>Aquarium Co-op is a website that sells fish, aquarium supplies, and aquarium plants. The reason I like this company is because the owners post a lot of videos on youtube detailing problems and solutions about aquariums, and these videos have proved very useful in my aquarium keeping. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.bhbreptiles.com">BHB Reptiles</a></dt>
            <dd>BHB reptiles sells just that, reptiles, from pythons to boas to lizards to scorpians. BHB reptiles sells all types of reptiles. The reason I like BHB reptiles is for the same reason I like Aquarium Co-op, the owners post many videos online about caring for the different types of reptiles, and while I do not have any reptiles of my own, I find the videos entertaining. </dd>
