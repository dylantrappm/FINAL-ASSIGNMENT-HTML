        <h1>Collections and Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I have heard many times that I get obsessed about things when I become interested in something. I do go deep down the rabbit hole when I start to enjoy a new hobby or new collection, one of my first collections I ever started was silver and gold bullion, ever since my first job where I was making checks of about $180 a week, I would put money aside and use it to buy silver coins. </p>

        <p>Some over hobbies that I have grown fond of over the years include:</p><br>

        <img src="silver.jpeg" height="260" width="auto" alt="Silver coins and bullion" style="float: right">
        <ul>
            <li>Watch collecting</li>
            <br>
            <li>Silver and Gold</li>
            <br>
            <li>Fish and Reptiles</li>
            <br>
            <li>Hats</li>
            <br>
            <li>Baseball cards</li>
            <br><br><br>
        </ul><br>



        <p>...But between all of the different hobbies and collections I don't think any have become more important to me as watches and silver bullion...</p>



        <img src="chronosharkWatch.jpeg" height="350px" width="auto" alt="breitling watch" style="float: left">
        <p>These are some images that include American Silver Eagle's, some of the most collectable silver bullion available which is 99.9% pure Ag. The majority of my collection is comprised of American Silver Eagles, however I also do have some vintage coins, such as 1964 Kennedy half dollars, which are 70% silver, and some silver and gold bars (not kilos, I wish) that are also 99.9% pure Ag and Au. </p>



        <br><br>

        <p> I also have pictured my dream watch at the moment. This is a Breitling Chronoshark, this watch is no longer made and costs about $2,500 on the second hand market. I like this watch because it is a great size, it is a chronometer, and the styling is exceptional. At the moment the watch is just a little outside my price range, but I hope to change that soon and add one of these to my collection </p>
